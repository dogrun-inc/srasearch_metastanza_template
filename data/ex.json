      "description": "Proteome analyses of human induced pluripotent stem cell line (201B7-P32) were carried out using a two-meter monolithic silica C18 capillary columns without prefractionation. Tryptic peptides from 4 μg cell lysates were directly injected onto the 100 μm i.d. monolithic silica-C18 column and an 8-h gradient was applied at 500 nL/min. Triplicate measurements were conducted and the merged results were searched against UniProt DB to identify peptides and proteins. The obtained results were filtered at 1% FDR thresholds by searching against the randomized decoy DB both at peptide and protein levels. This dataset with the PX complete submission format will be further used to generate a customized DB in this jPOST project.",
